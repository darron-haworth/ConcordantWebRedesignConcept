                The Concordant Publishing Concern is a nondenominational, nonprofit association
                founded in 1909 for the purpose of disseminating the facts and truths of the ancient
                manuscripts of the Scriptures.</p>

                CONCORDANT LITERAL NEW TESTAMENT</p>
            <p>
                with KEYWORD CONCORDANCE</p>
            <p>
                The Concordant Version presents God’s Word in a most useful form. It is a literal
                translation, seeking to carry over the Original text through a consistent–concordant–English
                vocabulary. The type is large and readable, with boldface representing the actual
                English translation of the original Greek and lightface showing English words added
                for idiomatic clarity or to reflect grammatical significance. Each page has wide
                margins. An abbreviation key is provided, and there is a comprehensive Explanatory
                Introduction as well as six pages of Instructions for Use.</p>
            <p>
                The Version is bound together with the KEYWORD CONCORDANCE, in which the English
                words used in the text are arranged alphabetically. It is at the same time a Greek
                concordance, because the entries, though listed in English form (according to the
                primary English Keywords), represent the original Greek words. In addition, the
                respective word in the Greek original is always added (in Roman characters) beside
                the English standard. At the end of each entry is given a list of all the words
                used in the Authorized (King James) Version for that Greek term. In addition, these
                AV terms appear in regular alphabetical order in this Concordance, together with
                a reference to the Concordant Keyword.</p>

                CONCORDANT GREEK TEXT</p>
            <p>
                This text gives all the readings of the three most ancient codices – Alexandrinus,
                Vaticanus and Sinaiticus. Although worthwhile readings from other sources, including
                the Papyri, the evidence of the Fathers, ancient versions, later manuscripts and
                modern scholarship were given ample consideration, it was found that the three major
                ancient texts contain every letter which modern editors deem genuine. Our CONCORDANT
                GREEK TEXT allows the reader to see every passage just as it was penned nearly two
                thousand years ago, in the ancient uncial alphabet.</p>
            <p>
                An ultra-literal and consistent English sublinear is provided which uniformly expresses
                the Greek grammar with English standards. Wherever possible the first letter of
                the English standard in the sublinear stands directly under the first letter of
                the corresponding Greek word. With a format uniform throughout to facilitate reference,
                there are 20 Greek letters to the line and 50 to the column, giving 1000 to the
                page. Readings variant from the basic text are given in the superlinear.</p>

                Greek Scriptures by word families, defines terms, lists occurences of all important
                grammatical forms, and includes a brief course in sacred Greek.</p>

                CONCORDANT VERSION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</p>
            <p>
                The ideal way to read the Old Testament is in its original languages, Hebrew and
                Chaldee (Aramaic). But as this is not ordinarily possible, the next best way is
                to use the CONCORDANT VERSION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. The same concordant principle
                is used in this translation as was used for the New Testament. Eight volumes are
                now available, each with an introduction explaining the features employed by this
                version, as well as the method of translation used to produce it. Boldface type,
                symbols and superior letters are used to indicate the words actually found in the
                Original. Lightface type indicates words added for clarity. Textual emendations
                are noted. In paperback.</p>

                ON THE NEW TESTAMENT</p>
            <p>
                A. E. Knoch’s Commentary was first published more than sixty years ago. It is based
                on the CONCORDANT LITERAL NEW TESTAMENT and follows the sequence of books from Matthew
                to Revelation. Important passages are dealt with succinctly, yet with remarkable
                helpfulness, especially in light of the relative brevity of the entries. Ample cross-references
                to notes on related sections of scripture are provided. Literary frameworks of the
                various books of the New Testament are included.</p>

                GOD’S EONIAN PURPOSE</p>
            <p>
                This work is a thorough review of God’s plan and purpose, gathering together many
                of the most basic themes of Scripture, including The Beginning of Creation, The
                Eons and Administrations, Justification, The Conciliation, Completeness in Christ,
                and The Goal of the Universe. These and other vital subjects are presented in an
                interesting and informative manner which will appeal to the sincere student of Scripture
                for the strengthening of faith. The book contains charts and illustrations which
                provide a welcome visual supplement to the text.</p>
            <p>
                We live in a day when few believers have a good grasp of the truth that God has
                a purpose. Many reason that as long as they themselves are saved, nothing else really
                matters. But to know Christ and to rejoice in the glory of God is just as important.
                We need to listen to His Word and receive the glorious revelations He has made concerning
                His operations and goal if we are to possess real joy and satisfying peace.</p>

            <p>
                Prophecy is of great value to our spirits in our everyday life. It exists not merely
                to afford us predictions concerning future events, but to reveal timeless truths
                for our use in the midst of the toil and turmoil of today. The political situation
                in the Middle East in the years to come is fully discussed in this book. See for
                yourself why we might watch for an upright ruler in a Greater Egypt to stand up
                as this event will probably be the first sign of the approaching time of the end.</p>

            <p>
                This publication is a compilation of the writings of A. E. Knoch on human destiny.
                The author examines three major theories on this topic current among students of
                Scripture. The striking phrase “All in all,” which pertains to the vivification
                of all mankind in 1 Corinthians 15:28 and relates to the reconciliation of the entire
                intelligent creation in Ephesians 1:23, is discussed at length. Two extensive appendices
                are included, exploring the usage of the terms “eon” and “eonian” in the Scriptures.</p>

            <p>
                Ephesians 6:13-17 is a favorite passage to many people. CHECK YOUR PANOPLY (the
                Whole Armor of God) explores its meaning for today, and its practical application
                with our prayer: “Our place in Christ will not exempt us from the wicked one’s attacks.
                We must be vigilant to maintain a sufficient and continuous supply of spiritual
                vitality. God in His wisdom has provided a complete suit of armor which is an entirely
                adequate protection against the stratagems of the Adversary.”</p>

                CHRIST TRIUMPHANT</p>
            <p>
                Originally published over 100 years ago, this book attempts to answer the question
                of questions: Can Evil triumph finally over Good? If we answer affirmatively with
                the popular creed, we are practically falling into Dualism. But if we reply in the
                negative, we are teaching Universalism. Such are the issues involved. Men strive
                to save the popular creed by various modifications: by diminishing the number of
                the lost, by softening their torments, or by asserting their annihilation. What
                are all these but so many tacit confessions that men everywhere feel it impossible
                to maintain the creed still generally professed? This early work on universal reconciliation
                deals with these things, and more. Like Jukes’ RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS, Allin’s
                CHRIST TRIUMPHANT includes much interesting church history.</p>

                THE MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL</p>
            <p>
                or The Secret of the Evangel.</p>
            <p>
                Somehow the very word “mystery” seems to shut the door of love in our faces instead
                of opening portals for it. The word “mystery” looms large and dark and shadowy.
                It seems to defy understanding. None but the wisest may even attempt the solution
                to a “mystery”! Not so with the mysteries in God’s Holy Word. They are simply secrets.
                Once they were hidden and could not be known. And yet, after God revealed them,
                they were easily understood by all who had ears to hear.</p>
            <p>
                When the apostle Paul was held captive in Rome, his burning desire was to blaze
                abroad the Secret. No longer could he go among the ecclesias to impart God’s glorious
                revelation, so in Ephesians 6:19 he asked his readers to pray for him that he might
                open his mouth with boldness “to make known the secret of the evangel.” (An excursus
                concerning the Greek terms aiõn (eon) and aiõnios (eonian) is included.)</p>

            <p>
                The author, who wrote FOUR VIEWS OF CHRIST and THE LAW OF THE OFFERINGS, also penned
                this work, which originally took form as an extensive letter to a friend in the
                1860s. This reprint brings the reader into an aspect of the author’s later ministry
                which may surprise some. In it he examines the Scriptures regarding the destiny
                of the human race.</p>

                This stimulating commentary on Galatians is sure to increase the student’s understanding
                of the apostle Paul’s epistle on liberty. Clear insight and careful exegesis work
                together to bring the reader into a greater appreciation of Paul’s ministry, especially
                his emphasis on the cross of Christ. In Galatians, the breadth and force of the
                apostle’s intellect, his boundless devotion to the Saviour, and the depth and warmth
                of his love reach their zenith.</p>

                THE GOSPEL OF OUR SALVATION</p>
            <p>
                This book explores the various evangels (or gospels) of the Scripture, with a special
                emphasis given to the message of God’s grace for believers today. These gospels
                are described chronologically and include the gospel which God brought to Abraham,
                the gospel Gabriel brought to Zechariah, the gospel an angel brought to the shepherds,
                the gospel Timothy brought from the Thessalonians to Paul, the gospel of the Circumcision,
                the gospel of the Uncircumcision (including the “Mystery”), the gospel of the unsearchable
                riches of Christ, and the eonian (“everlasting”) gospel of the book of Revelation.</p>

                SPIRIT, SPIRITS and SPIRITUALITY</p>
            <p>
                This book is a compilation of studies on the subject of spirit. Most of the material
                centers on Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians, with such topics as our spiritual blessings
                among the celestials, the sealing and earnest of the spirit, and the unity of the
                spirit. Spiritual warfare is discussed, as well as matters concerning the human
                spirit and the holy spirit of God.</p>

                DEATH, RESURRECTION, IMMORTALITY</p>
            <p>
                This work deals with the problem of death and God’s solution of resurrection and
                immortality through the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. Writing during his final
                illness, the author was not anticipating a passage into an intermediate state between
                death and resurrection, but rather looking forward to the gift of life and immortality
                provided by Christ’s victory. The widely accepted teaching of the immortality of
                the soul, which makes resurrection unnecessary and detracts from the value of our
                Lord’s sacrifice, is shown to be unscriptural. There are provided concordant studies
                of the words “soul” and “spirit,” which are certain to be of much value to the reader
                who wants to find scriptural truth on these subjects.</p>

            <p>
                The verbal pivot on which swings the question, “Does the Bible teach the doctrine
                of Endless Punishment?” is the word Aiõn and its derivatives and reduplications.
                The author of this treatise has endeavored to put within brief compass the essential
                facts pertaining to the history and use of the word, and he thinks he has conclusively
                shown that it affords no support whatever to the erroneous doctrine. Reprint of

                THE OUTCOME OF INFINITE GRACE</p>
            <p>
                “The last enemy to be destroyed is death!” It was this verse which caused the author,
                a pastor, to study afresh the subject of the fate of the wicked. The three choices
                apparent from a surface reading of various biblical texts were eternal torment,
                extermination or ultimate reconciliation. The author studied to find which one was
                true. This book is a result of that study. Says the author, “If it proves as satisfying
                to the reader as it has to the writer we shall have a delightful time ‘rejoicing
                in hope of the glory of God.’ ”</p>

                HOW TO SCRIPTURALLY STUDY THE SCRIPTURES</p>
            <p>
                The Sacred Scriptures are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ
                Jesus, both for the life which now is and the abundant life which is to come. God’s
                Word also reveals His unspeakable love, which alone can fill and satisfy every heart.
                So nothing can compare with the riches of the assurance of understanding in all
                His Word and will. His love constrains us to share the wealth of spiritual grace
                with all who have hearing ears and teachable spirits. This is the motivating purpose
                of this extensive exposition concerning administrational (“dispensational”) truth,
                that we might become qualified in the Lord’s service, “unashamed worker(s), correctly
                cutting the word of truth” (2 Tim.2:15).</p>

                Studies from Genesis 12-50. This writing presents the spiritual careers of Abraham
                and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph. God's dealings with these four patriarchs are rich
                in lessons of permanent value. With exquisite, artless simplicity they demonstrate
                the frailty of our frame, accentuate the gentle forbearance, and illustrate the
                exhaustless grace of our heavenly Father.</p>

                CHRIST AND DEITY</p>
            <p>
                That which authoritatively reveals the status of God the Father and our Lord Jesus
                Christ defines their relationship to the universe by means of two connectives: All
                is out of God, and, all is through our Lord. Hence we read, “For us there is one
                God, the Father, out of Whom all is, and we for Him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
                through Whom all is, and we through Him” (1 Cor.8:6). The contrast here is sharp
                and clear. It is the key to the part played by Christ in the course of the eons.
                Nothing originates out of Him or consummates into Him, though He is the Origin and
                the Consummation. All comes through Him, from the beginning to the end. CHRIST AND
                DEITY begins with this thesis and studies all its ramifications in depth.</p>

                CONSOLATION IN EXPECTATION</p>
            <p>
                It is striking to note that the earliest revelation concerning our own happy expectation
                was given to saints who were sorrowing for loved ones (1 Thess.4:18). And to this
                day one will not find more comforting words for the bereaved believer than in Paul’s
                message concerning those who were put to repose. Here we have the balm needed for
                our wounded feelings when a beloved believer is put to repose. The subjects covered
                in this booklet include: How the dead are roused; The expectation of His calling;
                Who shall go through the Great Tribulation; What is the Trumpet of God; and Who
                will be snatched away. Besides providing much practical teaching, this study clearly
                demonstrates that the Rapture–the time when we are snatched away to meet the Lord
                in the air–is a distinct event from, and surely an antecedent to, Christ’s appearance
                on the Mount of Olives. An excellent study.</p>

                ETERNAL TORMENT or UNIVERSAL RECONCILIATION?</p>
            <p>
                God’s goal for His creatures is clearly set forth in His Word. Yet devout and earnest
                men differ radically as to what the consummation will be. Those on all sides of
                the question feel very strongly that those opposing them are wrong. To resolve the
                question, the facts are examined by going to the original texts of Scripture. They
                contain no contradictions. Instead, all is clear, satisfactory and glorious: “The
                secret of God’s will . . .is to have an administration of the complement of the
                eons, to head up all in the Christ . . .” (Eph.1:9,10), and “to reconcile all to
                Him (making peace through the blood of His cross), through Him, whether those on
                the earth or those in the heavens” (Col.1:20). Most popular objections to this clear
                teaching of Scripture are considered.</p>

                saved, the completeness of salvation, the final goal of God’s love, the evangel
                and its ultimate consequences, and the definitive meaning of the Greek word aiõn.</p>

                as described in the book of Ephesians. That God is not only able to complete His
                purpose but that He is also actively engaged in its fulfillment is discussed in
                this uplifting study.</p>

                before His descent to become a man. When Christ is fully revealed, we no longer
                doubt His pre-existence but praise and worship Him as God’s Creative Original, in
                Whom and through Whom all else has been brought into existence, Who laid aside His
                preeminence for the form of a slave and humbled Himself, and went down to the accursed
                cross.</p>

                The letter to the Ephesians is an elaboration of the definition of the present secret
                economy that in spirit the nations are to be joint-enjoyers, a joint-body and joint-partakers
                of the promise in Christ Jesus through the evangel of which Paul became the dispenser.
                This is the “Ephesian secret”, concerning which the following study is presented.
                May it lead the believer into a greater perception and grasp of the love of God
                in which we are rooted and grounded!</p>

                Hebrew Scriptures), and the “conciliation” (the “secret of the evangel”) which had
                been hushed up in previous times. James Coram presents: a detailed exposition on
                the logical fallacies of “free will”; and a explanation of the use of the term “holy
                spirit” in the CONCORDANT VERSION.</p>

                the celestials with which we are blessed. Let us strive to live in the life and
                peace of God awaiting that day when we shall be living together with Christ, at
                the same time believing in our hearts that God, the Father, shall become All in

                The inspired Scriptures never speak of “eternity.” They describe nothing as eternal

                originally entitled “How Eternity Slipped In” is a classic study of the way in which
                human tradition can obscure the original meanings of words in the Scriptures.</p>

            <p>
                WHEN DID THE CHURCH BEGIN?</p>
            <p>
                Two separate studies are included in this booklet. The first, The Address on the
                Envelope, explains that the historic, prophetic and literary portions of Scripture
                are usually in the form of short scrolls. God’s latest and highest communications
                have come to us in the form of letters or, if more formal or of a public character,
                epistles. The epistolary portions of the Scriptures are usually introduced by some
                specific indication as to the person or persons from whom the epistle comes and
                to whom it is directed. Knowing this and applying this principle in a practical
                way will be of great help in learning to “correctly cut the Word of truth.” When
                Did the Church Begin? is a study centered in the book of Acts, answering the question
                asked through its title, giving special attention to the significance of Paul’s
                being “severed” (Acts 13:2), with a view toward establishing the ecclesia which
                is Christ’s body, beginning the ecclesia as it is today.</p>

                EONIAN: EVERLASTING or AGE-LASTING?</p>
            <p>
                This booklet explores what has become a prolific source of confusion–the usual inconsistency
                in rendering the Hebrew word olam and the Greek words aiõn and aiõnios (uniformly
                translated “eon” and “eonian” in the Concordant Version). These same terms in precisely
                identical settings are frequently represented by a variety of English words conveying
                widely divergent ideas, even antithetical concepts. Clearly, a study of the subject
                should be founded on the inspired Original alone.</p>

                THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS</p>
            <p>
                When interpreted as a fictional story, the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus offers
                no opposition to the teaching of the Old Testament concerning the death state. But
                when read as literal history it negates the entire volume of Hebrew revelation.
                The alternatives presented are either to allow this passage to dominate and control
                the explanation of the remainder of Scripture, or else to interpret these verses
                in such a way as will not conflict with or contradict it. To the student adopting
                the latter course, a grave difficulty seems to present itself: How can we interpret
                as a parable that which is not called such? On the other hand it must be admitted
                that a story (a record or account), in order to make an important point, may well
                be fictional; it need not be historical. The author notes that the entirety of Luke
                15 and 16 is a multipart parable but actually constitutes a singular teaching on
                a unified theme. The key elements in the Lord’s obviously fictional story of the
                Rich Man and Lazarus were drawn from Jewish Oral Tradition later recorded in the
                Talmud, from which citations and references are included.</p>

                THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS FOR TODAY</p>
            <p>
                The fourth chapter of Ephesians tells us what gifts are ours today. There are great
                changes. Most of the early gifts were dropped in this adjustment. They are no longer
                needed. Two new ones were added and three are carried over. It is worth every effort
                to clarify the relation between the gifts in 1 Corinthians and those in Ephesians.
                This work allows the reader to overcome the difficulties involved in this task.</p>

                TWO STUDIES ON HEAVEN AND HELL</p>
            <p>
                This booklet gives good introductory material on what Christ taught about heaven
                and “hell”, as well as revelation on this subject from the Old Testament and the
                epistles of Paul. To quote the author in his introduction: “There was a time when
                I thought I knew this well. But this knowledge which seemed so clear, so blessed,
                so wonderful when it first dawned upon me, changed more and more into an unsolvable
                problem, yes, even a hideous nightmare, because of the way the matter was presented
                to me in all the churches and meetings I attended.” This study will help the reader
                begin to solve the problem in his own mind.</p>

                THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY</p>
            <p>
                Reading of the marvelous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, who has not been struck with
                the last verse of the chapter: “Covet earnestly the best gifts”? That is what we
                would like to do! But what do the closing words mean: “And yet show I unto you a
                more excellent way”? Can it be that there is something even better than the best
                gifts? If so, what is it and how may we enjoy it? This booklet helps us find the
                answer.</p>

                THE POWER OF GOD</p>
            <p>
                That God is all-powerful is demonstrated using the illustration of His mighty dealings
                with Pharoah. In addition, the greatest manifestation of His strength, the work
                of the Cross, is considered.</p>

                THE PURPOSE OF GOD</p>
            <p>
                In God’s Word only one writer, the apostle Paul, speaks of the purpose of God, His
                view and control of human events. The apostle’s writings on this subject in Romans
                and 2 Timothy are explored.</p>

                BELIEVING THE EVANGEL</p>
            <p>
                In today’s popular formularized preaching the grace of God is unrecognized and effectually
                denied. Faith accords with grace, not “requirement-meeting.” If the evangel’s significance
                has become clouded to us through a mistaken belief that it is finally by our own
                obedience, the cross of Christ not withstanding, that we fend off God’s indignation,
                we will lose much precious truth of great practical value.</p>

                terms commonly mistranslated or otherwise associated with “hell.”</p>

                THE BLASPHEMY OF THE SPIRIT; OVERWHELMING GRACE AND “UNPARDONABLE” SIN</p>
            <p>
                Probably most people under biblical influence have been either perplexed or distressed
                by the alarming phrase, “the unpardonable sin.”. How many have morbidly imagined
                that they had committed this sin and spoiled their whole career! To the contrary,
                since Christ died for all that all might live, and all who will be saved will be
                saved by grace, it follows that eventually all will be saved, that God may be All
                in all.</p>

                ON BAPTISM</p>
            <p>
                This is a detailed study of baptism throughout the Scriptures. It discusses the
                meaning of baptism as it is associated with Israel and it’ rituals, the Kingdom
                and it’ prerequisites, and the Body of Christ with it’ “ baptism.”</p>

                SALVATION AND JUDGMENT IN THE BOOK OF MATTHEW; THE VOICE OF ONE IMPLORING</p>
            <p>
                First and second in a series of studies on the book of Matthew. When our Lord came
                into this world He came to save: “you shall be calling His name Jesus, for He shall
                be saving His people from their sins” (Matt.1:21). This important declaration of
                God's intention forms a solid basis for all that is recorded throughout the book
                of Matthew, and must be kept in mind in the midst of the stern warnings of judgment,
                even including that of “fire unextinguished”.</p>

                ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING; IF THE LORD IS WILLING</p>
            <p>
                Third and fourth in a series of studies on the book of Matthew. Jesus had announced
                the nearness of the kingdom, but the kingdom with its deliverance from the many
                evils of present life could not immediately appear. No one could achieve the perfection
                demanded by the Sermon on the Mount apart from a deliverance from sin. The death
                of Christ, as the One Who saves from sin, must occur first, and provide the basis
                for all the blessings of the kingdom.</p>

                SALVATION OF THE UNBELIEVER; GOD ALL IN ALL</p>
            <p>
                God has a goal. He intends to become All in all of His creatures. He will accomplish
                this by way of reconciling all His enemies by the blood of Christ's cross, by justifying,
                vivifying, and saving all mankind at the consummation. Those who believe now are
                saved by His grace. For those who do not believe there is a long, dark, and painful
                process of judgment, all the while leading to the same bright goal.</p>

                LORD SAVE US!; IN THE DAY OF JUDGING</p>
            <p>
                Fifth and sixth in a series of studies on the book of Matthew. The good news of
                the nearness of the kingdom was qualified by limitations and sober warnings through
                much of our Lord's ministry to Israel. And while severe losses and lamentations
                lay ahead for those who opposed or simply failed to heed the word, the fact remains
                that Jesus will eventually save Israel from their sins, even the sins of unbelief
                and enmity.</p>

            <p>
                This translation seeks to be idiomatic, while taking care to steer between the two
                extremes, of being too servile and literal on the one hand, or too periphrastic
                on the other. The usual translation of aiõn and aiõnion as “everlasting” or “eternal”,
                and the want of discernment in readers, has been a means of propagating the doctrine
                of endless damnation, God having no ultimate end in view but the endless misery
                of His creatures. The word aiõnion (herein rendered “aeonian”), though it is sometimes
                used of a short, and at other times of a long duration, simply expresses pertaining
                to duration or continuance.</p>

                CREATION (U.R. issue)</p>
            <p>
                God created this world in which we live. The heavens and the earth did not come
                about by themselves, nor did they arise out of nothing. All is out of God. Among
                these pages is the explanation of the import of God’s creation of evil. Three fundamental
                lessons are that God is active, evil has entered into God’s creation, and God gloriously
                disposes of evil by the power of His spirit and His word. What is the purpose of
                the former, present, and future creations? How do they serve for the sake of God,
                Christ, Satan, and humanity? These and other lessons are discussed in this issue
                of Unsearchable Riches magazine. As we learn of God’s plan, let us look forward
                to the glorious consummation of God’s creation.</p>

                The CONCORDANT VERSION of the book of Lamentations is presented here along with
                notes selected and adapted from a study written by Vladimir Gelesnoff. What is startling
                in this book is not simply the horror of Jerusalem’s devastation but the fact that
                this has come upon the very people and city marked out from the rest of the nations
                by special divine favor. These sorrows are traced to the divine activity of God
                Who is being revealed through the pains and sorrows of temporary affliction. The
                principle of God’s faithfulness in the midst of sufferings remains as vivid and
                meaningful to us as it was to the people of Judah so long ago.</p>

                JOHN THREE SIXTEEN</p>
            <p>
                This is a detailed study on the translation and mistranslation of this important
                verse of Scripture in which we read of the display of God’s love.</p>

                THE OBJECT OF CREATION</p>
            <p>
                Why is man in the world? The solution is found in the Scriptures alone, but even
                there it is not immediately evident. The wisdom of God in His design is shown.</p>

                THE LARGER HOPE</p>
            <p>
                A. E. Knoch’ reply to an article written in “Our Hope” magazine, which attempted
                to discredit the teaching of “universal reconciliation.”</p>

                WHAT IS DEATH?</p>
            <p>
                This study demonstrates that neither man as a whole nor any part of him enters a
                new, unknown condition at death. Death is an evidence of neither immortality nor
                annihilation.</p>

                WHAT IS THE SOUL?</p>
            <p>
                Is the soul spiritual or sensual? This question is carefully considered in the scriptural
                contexts where the word “soul” occurs. “Soul” is the sensation resulting from the
                combination of an organic body with breath, or spirit.</p>

                THE NEW BIRTH CONTRASTED WITH THE NEW CREATION</p>
            <p>
                This study contrasts these two distinct figures of speech associated with two distinct
                groups, believers in two distinct evangels.</p>

                THE DIVINE MYSTERIES</p>
            <p>
                A series of meditations on the scriptural secrets (“mysteries”) concerning: the
                Gospel, Callous Israel, the Secret Evangel, Marriage, Messiah, Resurrection, the
                Kingdom, the Seven Stars, Great Babylon, Lawlessness and Godliness.</p>

                THE “ONE BAPTISM”</p>
            <p>
                This study contrasts Paul’s “one baptism” into “one body,” with the baptism associated
                with the “Great Commission,” to disciple and baptize the nations.</p>

                A Concordant Study in Greek and English Grammar. Mr. Knoch explains and defends
                the CONCORDANT VERSION’ rendering of the indefinite (commonly called “aorist”) tense.</p>

                THE INCOMMUNICABLE NAME</p>
            <p>
                Men have more sense of awe when speaking of earthly dignitaries than when referring
                to Him Who is above them all. The pronunciation and especially the meaning of God’s
                name are studied here.</p>

            <p>
                Israel was commanded to keep holy the sabbath day. As this is one of the Ten Commandments,
                are believers also to observe the sabbath?</p>

                in Christ Jesus. How shall we appreciate our new position in Christ?</p>

                THE SON OF ABRAHAM</p>
            <p>
                The title “Son of Abraham” is pregnant with blessing for all the nations of the
                earth, as well as rights to the land of promise. Material and spiritual blessings
                through Abraham are studied and distinguished.</p>

            <p>
                The night, although darkest just before dawn, is far spent and the day is at hand,
                a day of a very special nature: “That Day”! Helpful consolation from the Scriptures.</p>

                SUFFERING vs. DEATH</p>
            <p>
                Sin’s entrance into the world resulted in two distinct penalties: suffering and
                death. One affects our souls; the other, our spirits. This study explores the role
                of each.</p>

                TORTURING DOUBTS or EXULTANT FAITH?</p>
            <p>
                We can banish doubts arising from reading discordant translations of Scripture.
                Scripture is not contradictory. The Devil takes nothing, and God is shown to be
                truly omnipotent.</p>

            <p>
                How shall we realize power and triumph over the enemy? By standing in Christ, withstanding
                the foes.</p>

                THE WORDS OF MAN’S WISDOM</p>
            <p>
                God knew that men would invent their own theological terms and that this would be
                the most subtle of all means for deceiving His saints.</p>
