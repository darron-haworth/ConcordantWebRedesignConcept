                The Concordant Publishing Concern is a nondenominational, nonprofit association
                founded in 1909 for the purpose of disseminating the facts and truths of the ancient
                manuscripts of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
                In addition to our principal works, the Concordant Literal New Testament with Keyword
                Concordance and the Concordant Version of the Old Testament, our other publications
                include, the Concordant Greek Text and the Concordant Commentary, together with
                a wide variety of additional books and booklets on scriptural themes. We also publish
                the Concordant Literal Version, computer edition.</p>
            <p>
                Our bimonthly magazine, Unsearchable Riches, is now in its one hundred-first year
                of publication (both scripture and topic indexes are available, in printed and computer
                form). A considerable number of our expositions are available on-line, both in standard
                HTML format, as well as in PDF format.</p>
