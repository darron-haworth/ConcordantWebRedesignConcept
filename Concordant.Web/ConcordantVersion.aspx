                The text both of the Concordant Literal New Testament as well as of the various
                fascicles of the Concordant Version of the Old Testament consists of frequent interchange
                between boldface and lightface words, besides many special symbols and superior
                characters. Since such specialized and complex typography cannot be satisfactorily
                represented in standard web page format, we have prepared the samples below as PDF
                documents, reproduced directly from the original typesetting. If you have a good
                graphics card, monitor, and printer, you will be able to view and reproduce every
                detail of these high-quality sample documents.</p>
            <p>
                Publications furnished in PDF file format require the free Adobe Acrobat Reader,
                which provides exceptionally high-quality viewing and printing, closely replicating
                the original, printed document. The Acrobat Reader functions as a plug-in (for both
                Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers), and also as an independent program.</p>

            <p>
                THIS VOCABULARY INDEX is an attempt to provide users of the CONCORDANT VERSION OF
                THE OLD TESTAMENT (CVOT) access to full listings of the occurrences of each major
                Hebrew or Aramaic (Chaldee) word (except most proper names) used in the Old Testament.
                It is admittedly more complex and less convenient than the KEYWORD CONCORDANCE published
                with the CONCORDANT LITERAL NEW TESTAMENT. But until such a concordance using the
                vocabulary of the CVOT can be made available this may serve as a useful substitute.
                This is an abridgment of a full list of the English terms used in the CVOT, still
                being updated in 2009 as work proceeds on a first edition of the Version as a whole.
                The list is keyed to ENGLISHMAN'S HEBREW AND CHALDEE CONCORDANCE (EHCC, 5th edition),
                which is presently available under the title, ENGLISHMAN'S HEBREW CONCORDANCE (Hendrickson
                Publishers, Peabody MA 01961-3473, ISBN 0- 913573-21-3). The word entries in this
                latter edition are coded to the numbering system of STRONG'S EXHAUSTIVE CONCORDANCE,
                and these numbers are also provided here in our index.</p>

                Note: The research and translation work for the Concordant Version of the Old Testament
                (CVOT) has continued for many years. While it is relatively near to completion as
                a single volume, it is impossible to give an estimated date of publication. The
                entire CVOT, however, is now available in printed form, comprised in five, large-page-size
                perfect bound books.</p>

                The Concordant Literal New Testament</p>
            <p>
                As a convenience, we are also including the complete text of the Concordant Literal
                New Testament in HTML format. While this presentation of the CLNT does not include
                the various textual notations of the printed text or the PDF files, we trust these
                pages will serve as a further means of introducing you to the CONCORDANT VERSION.
                Selected books also include the text of the KING JAMES VERSION, for comparison.</p>

                The noble language which has been immortalized as the chosen vehicle of God's highest
                revelation cannot be clearly understood or appreciated by the English reader unless
                he becomes acquainted with the ELEMENTS of which the words are composed as well
                as with the words themselves. For example, the words repentance and regret are greatly
                clarified when we know that the former is an after-MIND and the latter is an after-CARE.
                It is also of the utmost interest and value to form the acquaintance of the whole
                family to which each word belongs. Many Greek words are translated destroy in other
                versions. What is the exact significance of each? Hitherto it has required an extensive
                knowledge of Greek to enjoy these priceless advantages. Now all of this is comfortably
                available to the English reader in the following pages.</p>

                A. E. Knoch devoted a lifetime to the development of a concordant (i.e., harmonious
                and practically consistent) translation of the Scriptures, one that was as accurate
                and literal as the constraints of idiom and good diction would permit. The Concordant
                Version employs a method of translation that takes into account the superhuman perfection
                of the scriptural writings, even to the minutest detail (Matt.5:18). Though the
                Version includes many technical features, ones which can be of great value to the
                advanced student, its greatest benefit accrues even to the ordinary reader whenever
                it is simply read, carefully and thoughtfully, whether in devotional reading or
                study.</p>

                “Scripture Translation Principles”</p>
            <p>
                Scripture translation principles are a matter of great importance to us all, for
                only as sound principles of translation are followed can an accurate translation
                be made. It is most unwise to find assurance in the consensus of popular opinion,
                especially in an era of apostasy. To “translate,” is to express in another language.
                To the degree that, in our version, we have conveyed or reflected the vocabulary
                terms and grammatical forms of the original writing within the corresponding document
                in the receptor language, we have made a translation. The translators of the Concordant
                Version have endeavored to translate in such a way so as to provide a uniform and
                accurate, substantially literal work.</p>
            <p>
                “Proponents for a Literal Translation of the New Testament”</p>
            <p>
                The Concordant Version and Concordant Method are tested against standards proposed
                by recognized scholars in the field of translation. The author asserts, “Our literal
                equivalents and controlled idioms are ... serious efforts to guard against bias,
                to avoid religious cant or jargon, and to have respect for the two cultural worlds
                in which the reader and the translator are involved. Any Version should reproduce
                the Original, not reflect the religious milieu of the translator. The reader has
                the right to know what God says, exactly, accurately, literally.”</p>

            <p>
                To trace the story of the Sacred Scriptures from the days when the first inspired
                autographs were made by godly men, divinely chosen for the work, down through the
                stormy vicissitudes of the centuries, to this era in which we enjoy them in the
                English language printed and bound in handy book form, is a story without a parallel
                in the whole range of sacred or secular history. In the scope of this article, we
                purpose to deal with versions and translations. Through the many streams—Hebrew,
                Chaldee, Greek, Syriac, Latin, Anglo­Saxon—the Sacred Word has flowed increasingly
                onward. Yet let it be remembered that God inspired the original documents of the
                Scriptures, but He did not inspire versions made of them by men.</p>
