                WELCOME to the web site of the Concordant Publishing Concern, which is a denominationally
                independent nonprofit association for Scripture research. An associated ministry,
                <a href="http://www.konkordanterverlag.de" target="_blank">Konkordanter Verlag</a>,
                is maintained in Germany (Leipziger Str. 11, D-75217 Birkenfeld, Germany; Phone
                07231-485620), having been first established there in the 1930’s.</p>
            <p>
                Founded in 1909 in Los Angeles, California, since 1950 the Concern’s office has
                been located in Santa Clarita, a city in northern Los Angeles county.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Concern is not a church, but a translating and teaching ministry. Our bi-monthly
                magazine, Unsearchable Riches, first published in 1909, is now in its 96th year.
                A recent compilation, What Is The Concordant Publishing Concern? explains, in the
                words of one of our founders, the philosophy which continues to guide us. We seek
                to be of service to all, while lording over the faith of none. Though we have nothing
                to join, we ourselves gladly join in “pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace,
                with all who are invoking the Lord out of a clean heart” (2 Tim.2:22), irrespective
                of organizational affiliation or the lack thereof. A number of small congregations
                exist, whether in the United States or elsewhere in the world, which, though in
                general accord with our ministry, are independently organized and led.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our principal works are the Concordant Literal New Testament with Keyword Concordance,
                and the Concordant Version of the Old Testament. Our research efforts are centered
                upon the many issues involved in discovering the meaning of the original Scripture
                declarations themselves. Then we seek to determine how we may best translate these
                same Scriptures, endeavoring to do so objectively, accurately, and consistently.
                Our translation principles, both of vocabulary and grammatical analysis, govern
                all that we do.</p>
            <p>
                We first seek to determine essence of word meaning; wherever possible, according
                to internal scriptural evidence. For each Original word, then, we assign a STANDARD
                English word. To facilitate a readable English translation, additional synonyms
                or other concordant variants are also used, as needed. In nearly all cases, any
                such standards, synonyms, and variants are used exclusively for a single word in
                the Original, thereby eliminating almost all “crosswiring” between languages. Thus
                a substantial formal correspondency is maintained between the original and receptor
                language. It is such very principles of translation themselves, together with our
                many years of refining our efforts according to these principles, which distinguish
                our work, and its results, from that of others.</p>
            <p>
                Though we do not have a formal “statement of faith,” we have prepared a précis of
                our comprehensive writings comprised in our published works entitled, “Some of the
                Special Truths for Which We Stand,” which will serve for this purpose.</p>
            <p>
                We have much useful information to share with our fellow believers in Christ Jesus.
                We invite you to investigate and test our material, searching the Scriptures yourself
                to see whether we are properly representing God's Word. We welcome your comments
                and evaluation—whether favorable or otherwise.</p>
            <p>
                “For the rest, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is grave, whatever is just,
                whatever is pure, whatever is agreeable, whatever is renowned—if there is any virtue,
                and if any applause, be taking these into account. What you learned also, and accepted
                and hear and perceived in me, these be putting into practice, and the God of peace
                will be with you” (Phil.4:8,9).
            </p>
